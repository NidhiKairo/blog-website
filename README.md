# blog-website
The server listens for HTTP GET requests on different routes and responds by rendering the relevant template with dynamic content. The script uses the 'express' module to create the server and define routes, the 'ejs' module to render the templates, and the 'lodash' module to manipulate strings. The script defines four constants which store static content for the home, about, and contact pages, and an empty array called 'posts' which is used to store the content for the blog posts. The server listens for GET requests on routes such as '/', '/about', '/contact', '/compose', and '/posts/:value', and renders the corresponding templates with the appropriate dynamic content. The server also listens for POST requests on the '/compose' route and adds a new blog post to the 'posts' array. The server listens for connections on port 3000.
